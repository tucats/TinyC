//  MAIN CLASS
//
//  This class defines the generalized object for TinyC.  It allows the caller
//  to specify a file or string containing a TinyC program, and comiple it for
//  execution.  The compilation is maintained as a property of the TinyC object;
//  there should be one instance for each module compiled.
//
//  Once compiled, the object can be executed repeatedly by calling the appropriate
//  method.
